Cucumber Framework

Rules of Cucumber
1. Create a project
2. Create a Feature file in Gherkin
3. Implement the steps in scenarios of Feature file


Maven simple project

Project Name
	src/main/java - All the supporting files that is needed to run the test cases
	src/main/resources - dependent/supporting files that are needed for src/main/java code (stritly no code here)
	src/test/java - Test cases that should be executed
	src/test/resources - dependent/supporting files that are needed for src/test/java code (stritly no code here)
	pom.xml -- Add dependencies and plugins

Gherkin

Given - All the Pre-Condition of that test case
When - Step or the action that needs to be performed
Then - Expected result for the action performed
And - Supporting keyword for all others (Combine statements for multiple keywords)
But - Expected result (Negative scenarios) for the action performed
