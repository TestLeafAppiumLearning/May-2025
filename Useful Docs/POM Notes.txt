Page Object Model Framework

Rules of POM
1. Reusable methods should be created
2. Every page should be a separate class and extend the reusable method
3. Every action should be a separate method in pages
4. Every method should have a return type and return to the page it lands post completion of that method
5. Verify the page it has been landed or not
