Option 1:
1. Use the developer mac to build the WebDriverAgent.ipa for the real device and get that application stored in local
2. Use preBuiltWDA capability to use that app and the path of the WDA app in local
Challenge:
1. If the local Xcode or appium version has updated, this will not work. You need to again build the app and store in local
2. Same WDA will not work for all the iOS versions

Option 2:
1. WebDriverAgent application is already installed in mobile
2. Use preBuiltWDA capability as true
Challenge: If the iOS version has updated in mobile or the Xcode is updated this might not work and the app installed is built with older versions of Xcode

Note: Above 2 option will not work in all cases

Option 3:
To build the WDA in local machine everytime and access it or run that app in my mobile
